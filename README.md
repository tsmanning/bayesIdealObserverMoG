# MoGpaper

This toolbox contains MATLAB scripts and functions for fitting a Bayesian ideal observer model with a mixture of Gaussians prior to psychophysical data. For reference, see the main body of the paper.

# Table of Contents

##./figureScripts/
Contains the scripts used to generate all figures in the paper.

##./sharedTools/
Contains a set of helper functions for the rest of the functions.

##./MoGmodel/
Contains the main functions needed for fitting the ideal observer model to a set of psychophysical data.

##./errorAnalysis/
Contains simulation script used to generate simulated observer scenarios to show the distribution of error in the analytical approximation of the psychometric function for 2AFC data.

# Additional notes:
This toolbox uses "arrow.m"[^1] to plot arrows in some figure scripts. See reference for a link to download the file from MATLAB Central File Exchange.
